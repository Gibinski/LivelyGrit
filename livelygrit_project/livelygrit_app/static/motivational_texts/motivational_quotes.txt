Believe you can and you're halfway there. - Theodore Roosevelt
The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible. - Charles Kingsleigh
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. - Steve Jobs
Trust the process and don't forget to enjoy the journey.
Believe in yourself, and success will follow.
Never lose faith that you can achieve anything.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
